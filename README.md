# PPE Violation Detection System üõ°Ô∏è

Welcome to the PPE Violation Detection System project repository! This system is designed to enhance workplace safety by detecting violations of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) protocols in real-time video streams.

## Overview üåü

The PPE Violation Detection System utilizes state-of-the-art object detection techniques to identify PPE items such as helmets, safety goggles, and vests worn by individuals in the workplace. By deploying this system, employers can enforce PPE regulations and minimize the risk of accidents and injuries.

## Features ‚ú®

- Real-time monitoring of video streams for PPE violations
- High accuracy detection using the YOLOv7 object detection model trained on PyTorch
- Instant notification of safety breaches via the Google Gmail API
- User-friendly web interface for seamless integration into existing workflows

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with the PPE Violation Detection System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download pre-trained YOLOv7 weights and configuration files.
4. Run the system using the provided scripts.

## Usage üéØ

1. Launch the Flask web interface by running `python app.py`.
2. Upload video streams or connect to live feeds for real-time monitoring.
3. Receive instant email notifications of safety breaches every 10 minutes.
